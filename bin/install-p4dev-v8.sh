# This script differs from install-p4dev-v6.sh as follows:

# * Installs all Python3 packages into a virtual environment created
#   via `python3 -m venv <venv-name>`, instead of in system-wide
#   directories like /usr/local/lib   See [Note 1] below.
# * Install more recent Thrift (0.16)

# [Note 1]
# One motivation for this change is that Ubuntu 23.04 now by default
# gives an error when you try to use 'sudo pip3 install ...' to
# install a Python package in a system-wide directory.  Thus it seems
# likely that something in this script needs to change to support
# Ubuntu 23.04 and probably later versions of Ubuntu.  Another reason
# is that it avoids some of the hacky code I have in
# install-p4dev-v6.sh to move installed Python packages from the
# site-packages directory to the dist-packages directory.

# Remember the current directory when the script was started:

# max_parallel_jobs calculates a number of parallel jobs N to run for

# larger than the number of CPU cores on the system, so calculate a

# Also, if N is so large that the processes started in parallel exceed
# the available memory on the system, it can cause the system to copy

# processes, to reduce system memory usage, which causes the overall

pip3 install psutil crcmod

# Install p4runtime-shell from source repo, with a slightly modified
# setup.cfg file so that it allows us to keep the version of the
# protobuf package already installed earlier above, without changing
# it, and so that it does _not_ install the p4runtime Python package,
# which would replace the current Python files in
# ${PYTHON_VENV}/lib/python*/site-packages/p4 with ones generated
# using an older version of protobuf.

# First install a known working version of the grpcio package, because
# otherwise installing p4runtime-shell packages will likely pick some
# very recent version of grpcio that may cause trouble.
