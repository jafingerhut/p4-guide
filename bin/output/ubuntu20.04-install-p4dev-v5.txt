This script installs pre-compiled Debian packages of the P4_16 (and
also P4_14) compiler, and the behavioral-model software packet
forwarding program, that can behave as just about any legal P4
program.

It is regularly tested on freshly installed Ubuntu 20.04 systems,
with all Ubuntu software updates as of the date of
testing.  See this directory for log files recording the last
date this script was tested on its supported operating systems:

    https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide/tree/master/bin/output

As of 2021-Nov-14, the files installed by this script consume about 2
GB of disk space.  Running the script downloads about 250 MBytes of
data from the Internet.

On a 2015 MacBook Pro with a decent speed Internet connection
and an SSD drive, running Ubuntu Linux in a VirtualBox VM, it
took about 3 minutes.

Note: switching to 'aa0176fce6fb718a03474f8719261b07b670d30d'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at aa0176f 2.3.1b1 (#1124)
