This software has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and
20.04, and is known to fail in a few tests on Ubuntu
16.04.

Proceed installing manually at your own risk of
significant time spent figuring out how to make it all
work, or consider getting VirtualBox and creating an
Ubuntu virtual machine with one of the tested versions.

Here is what command 'lsb_release -a' shows this OS to be:
No LSB modules are available.

This script builds and installs the P4_16 (and also P4_14)
compiler, and the behavioral-model software packet forwarding
program, that can behave as just about any legal P4 program.

It is regularly tested on freshly installed Ubuntu 18.04 and
20.04 system, with all Ubuntu software updates as of the date of
testing.  See this directory for log files recording the last
date this script was tested on its supported operating systems:

    https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide/tree/master/bin/output

The files installed by this script consume about 11 GB of disk space.

On a 2015 MacBook Pro with a decent speed Internet connection
and an SSD drive, running Ubuntu Linux in a VirtualBox VM, it
took about 90 to 100 minutes.

Versions of software that will be installed by this script:

+ protobuf: github.com/google/protobuf v3.6.1
+ gRPC: github.com/google/grpc.git v1.17.2, with patches for Ubuntu 20.04
+ PI: github.com/p4lang/PI latest version
+ behavioral-model: github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model latest version
  which, as of 2020-Dec-12, also installs these things:
  + thrift version 0.11.0
  + nanomsg version 1.0.0
  + nnpy git checkout c7e718a5173447c85182dc45f99e2abcf9cd4065 (latest as of 2015-Apr-22
+ p4c: github.com/p4lang/p4c latest version
+ Mininet: github.com/mininet/mininet latest version
+ Python packages: grpcio 1.17.1, protobuf 3.6.1
+ Python packages: scapy, ipaddr, psutil, crcmod

Note that anything installed as 'the latest version' can change
its precise contents from one run of this script to another.
That is an intentional property of this script -- to get the
latest version of that software.  If you want particular
versions that are not the latest, you can modify this script by
adding 'git checkout <tag>' and/or 'git checkout <commit-sha>'
command at the appropriate places.

Note: checking out 'v3.6.1'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 48cb18e... Updated change log for 3.6.1 release

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

Note: checking out 'tags/v1.17.2'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at c7cc34e... Merge pull request #17446 from moriarty/cherry-pick-fix-bazel-0.20

Libraries have been installed in:

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

commit a6330594486261b87560881ad2fd7db35f13ddfd
Author: Andy Fingerhut <andy_fingerhut@alum.wustl.edu>
Date:   Wed Dec 9 11:51:21 2020 -0800

    Replace at least most occurrences of python with python3 (#960)
    
    * Replace at least most occurrences of python with python3
    This enables running on an Ubuntu system that has no /usr/bin/python
    executable at all, only python3.
    
    So far, there are still probably occurrences of python or python2 in
    these places:
    
    tools/macos/ and files in subdirectories beneath it
    tools/cpplint.py
    Dockerfile.noPI
    
    I have tested with these changes on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, but not on
    maOS.
    
    * Remove known Python code added explicitly for Python2 compatibility
    Also revert change to tools/cpplint.py, which is still Python2 only

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
