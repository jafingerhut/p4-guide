## actions-1-same-name.p4

Exit status 1 from p4c, with this error message:
```bash
$ p4c --target bmv2 --arch v1model --p4runtime-files actions-1-same-name.p4info.txtpb actions-1-same-name.p4
actions-1-same-name.p4(8): [--Werror=duplicate] error: foo: Duplicates declaration foo
    action foo (inout bit<8> x) { x = (x >> 3); }
           ^^^
actions-1-same-name.p4(7)
    action foo (in bit<8> x, out bit<8> y) { y = (x >> 2); }
           ^^^
[--Werror=overlimit] error: 1 errors encountered, aborting compilation
```

This seems like a reasonable error message to me.
Neither a P4Info nor a BMv2 JSON file are generated by p4c.

Note that the same error is even given if you run the command `p4test
actions-1-same-name.p4`, when I believe no code related the generation
of P4Info files is begin executed.  That seems good that the error is
independent of control plane API generation.


## actions-2-same-name.p4

Exit status 1 from p4c, with this error message:
```bash
$ p4c --target bmv2 --arch v1model --p4runtime-files actions-2-same-name.p4info.txtpb actions-2-same-name.p4
actions-2-same-name.p4(2): [--Werror=duplicate] error: foo duplicates foo.
action foo (inout bit<8> x) { x = (x >> 3); }
       ^^^
actions-2-same-name.p4(1)
action foo (in bit<8> x, out bit<8> y) { y = (x >> 2); }
       ^^^
```

This seems like a reasonable error message to me.
Neither a P4Info nor a BMv2 JSON file are generated by p4c.

Note that the same error is even given if you run the command `p4test
actions-2-same-name.p4`, when I believe no code related the generation

## actions-5-no-annot.p4

P4Info file has 3 actions with expected names: a1, a2, NoAction

Table t1 has 2 action_refs to actions: a1, NoAction

Table t2 has 2 action_refs to actions: a2, NoAction

No compile time errors or warnings.  Exit status 0.

Summary: I see no surprises here.  This is not a corner case program.
This is identical to actions-5-same-name-annot.p4, except the `@name`
annotations have been deleted.


## actions-5-same-name-annot.p4

P4Info file has 2 actions named: apiname1, NoAction

Table t1 has 2 action_refs to actions: apiname1, NoAction

Table t2 has 2 action_refs to actions: apiname1 (same id as action
apiname1 for table t1 above), NoAction

No compile time errors or warnings.  Exit status 0.

Summary: The source program clearly has 2 actions with functionally
different behaviors (plus NoAction).  It is a bug that the P4Info file
only mentions one action other than NoAction.

The BMv2 JSON file for this program is nearly identical to that for
actions-5-no-annot.p4.  It does not cause an error when starting
`simple_switch_grpc`.  I think this is because the BMv2 JSON file has
its own numerical ids for each action that are independently generated
from the P4Info file ids for each action, so even even though the two
actions have the same name `apiname1`, they have different "BMv2 JSON
numeric ids", and tables `t1` and `t2` in the BMv2 JSON file each use
that unique numeric id to refer to the correct action elsewhere in the
file.


## actions-6-no-annot.p4

P4Info file has 3 actions with expected names: a1, a2, NoAction

Table t1 has 2 action_refs to actions: a1 (with 2 parameters), NoAction

Table t2 has 2 action_refs to actions: a2 (with 1 parameter), NoAction

No compile time errors or warnings.  Exit status 0.

Summary: I see no surprises here.  This is not a corner case program.
This is identical to actions-6-same-name-annot.p4, except the `@name`
annotations have been deleted.


## actions-6-same-name-annot.p4

P4Info file has 2 actions named: apiname1 (with 2 parameters), NoAction

Table t1 has 2 action_refs to actions: apiname1 (with 2 parameters), NoAction

Table t2 has 2 action_refs to actions: apiname1 (with 2 parameters,
same id as action apiname1 for table t1 above), NoAction

No compile time errors or warnings.  Exit status 0.

Summary: The source program clearly has 2 actions with functionally
different behaviors (plus NoAction).  It is a bug that the P4Info file
only mentions one action other than NoAction.

I suspect it is a semi-arbitrary implementation choice somewhere in
p4c that it used 2 parameters for the action it calls apiname1 instead
of 1.

TODO: Compare the BMv2 JSON files of actions-6-no-annot.p4 and
actions-6-same-name-annot.p4.  I would not be surprised if they were
both correct, for the same reasons that the BMv2 JSON file for
actions-5-same-name-annot.p4 is correct.


## issue-1949.p4

Exit status 1 from the following command, and an error message as
shown below:
```bash
$ p4c --target bmv2 --arch v1model --p4runtime-files issue-1949.p4info.txtpb issue-1949.p4
Attempt to add to json object a value for a label which already exists foo null
```

Since it seems to me that the source program is not well-defined in
its control plane API behavior, because of two identical `@name`
annotations on two actions, it seems better to get some error, rather
than no error.

However, it _does_ generate a P4Info file.  More worrisome, the
following command gives exit status 0, no error message, and produces
the same P4Info file as the command above, implying (I believe
wrongly) that nothing is wrong in the control plane API generation:
```bash
$ p4test --p4runtime-files a.p4info.txtpb issue-1949.p4
```

P4Info file has 2 actions with names: foo, NoAction, whereas the P4
source code has NoAction plus two other actions that are functionally
different from each other in their behavior, so this seems like a bug.

Table t1 has one action_ref to NoAction, which is correct, plus 2
action_refs to the same id, which seems like a bug.

In my (Andy Fingerhut's) opinion, the correct behavior here is that
the control plane API generation step of p4c (or an earlier step)
should give an error that there are two actions with the same name,
because two actions have the same `@name` annotation string.  No
P4Info file nor binary should be generated.


## actions-7-annot-same-as-action-name.p4 is a minor variation of

P4Info file has 2 actions named: a1, NoAction

Table t1 has 2 action_refs to actions: a1, NoAction

Table t2 has 2 action_refs to actions: a1 (same id as action a1 for
table t1 above), NoAction

No compile time errors or warnings.  Exit status 0.

Summary: The source program clearly has 2 actions with functionally
different behaviors (plus NoAction).  It is a bug that the P4Info file
only mentions one action other than NoAction.
